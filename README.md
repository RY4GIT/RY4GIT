### Hi there 👋
My name is Ryoko (she/her/hers) and I am a hydrologist!  
The research questions I am tackling are
- 🛰️🌱 How does soil moisture controls hydrological and land-atmosphere processes at multiple spatio-temporal scales?
- 💭🖥️ How to represent the processes in modeling?
- 🌊🤝 How to leverage the research outcomes for flood and drought management under climate and land-use changes?

Visit [my website](http://labusers.net/~raraki/) for more details!
