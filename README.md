### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ryoko (she/her/hers) and I am a hydrologist! 
The research questions I am tackling are
- How does soil moisture controls hydrological and land-atmosphere processes at multiple spatio-temporal scales?
- How to represent the processes in modeling?
- How to leverage the research outcomes for flood and drought management under climate and land-use changes?
